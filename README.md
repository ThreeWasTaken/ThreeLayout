# ThreeLayout : Windows/Linux
A keyboard layout for the French devs that's neither fully QWERTY or AZERTY

So this keyboard layout was originally just for me, but now there's a few people using it.

Why a new layout?

Basically AZERTY sucks even for typing french, too many dead keys, three 'e' keys, two 'u's, keys we never used at all...
But qwerty isn't realistic of a choice, we still need to be able to type French. But here's the thing:
We're used to the AZERTY letter layout, and the QWERTY side of the force is much more organized when it comes
to symbols layout (){}[]<>"'-_ they're all properly placed. So here's the idea, let's mash them together and
add a bit of convenience/logic to make it just french enough.

What are the benefits?

-AZERTY letter layout (What you're used to as a French dev)
-QWERTY symbols layout (Symbols convenience)
-Easy ways to use accents (Better french typing)
-Numbers by default (QWERTY style)
-You can now use qwerty keycaps set (As long as your caps are all the same height: XDA DSA MOA MAO...)

...And you can now easily type stuff like Ç È À....

in a nutshell:

altgr is used as a modifier:
altgr + a = â (same with every other vowel) 
altgr + c = ç
altgr + shift + c = Ç

grave accents are done the american way

and so on...

Here is the detailed layout and custom keybaords using it:
